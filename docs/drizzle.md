- Database Provider: The project uses PostgreSQL as its database, known for its robustness and popularity in relational database management.

- Drizzle ORM: The project uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions, offering a type-safe and user-friendly interface. The primary dependencies include drizzle-orm and drizzle-kit.

- Database Connection: The PostgreSQL database connection is facilitated by the postgres library, a high-performance client for Node.js. Connection strings are securely managed via environment variables.

- Schema Definition: The database schema is defined in lib/db/schema.ts, encompassing tables for users, teams, team members, activity logs, and invitations. This file also outlines the inter-table relationships and exports TypeScript types, ensuring application-wide type safety.

- Migrations: Database migrations are managed using drizzle-kit, with migration files in the lib/db/migrations directory. The package.json file contains scripts for easy migration generation and application.

- Queries: Database queries for the application are centralized in lib/db/queries.ts, using Drizzle's query builder to create type-safe queries. This file illustrates the methods for data retrieval and manipulation from the database.
